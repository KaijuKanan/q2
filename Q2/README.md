# Final Question 2

_Always open your README.md in preview mode in vscode!!!_

## Program  
When complete, your project should include the following files:  
- complexNumber.cpp
- complexNumber.h
- main.cpp
- main.h
- makefile 
- README.md  


Your executable should be named ```complex```   

## Programming Problem
For this part of your final, you have been given main.cpp, complexNumber.h, complexNumber.cpp, as well as the makefile that will compile the given files into a final executable. 

Modify the complexNumber class so that it can work with real and imaginary numbers that are ints, floats, doubles, or some combination and so that a fraction can be output to a stream directly using an insertion operator overload. If your code works correctly, it should work without any changes to the main function. To complete this question, do the following:
1) modify complexNumber so that it will accept ints, floats, doubles, etc as the real/imaginary data type. You should not assume they will always be the same data type. You should not have to make any changes to the existing functions other than to change datatype of returns, parameters, and/or local variables of unknown type in this step.
2) modify the makefile so that the program successfully compiles with your changes.


Extra credit: create a file called better.txt. In the file, explain how you could improve this program. 5 points.


## Submission details
To submit your project,zip all of your code into a folder named /<netid/>_complexNumber_answer.zip

`sarad_complexNumber_answer.zip` for example

BE CAREFUL- if you are on windows and using WSL, zipping in windows instead of WSL may result in your makefile being renamed which will result in loss of credit. 

## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a studentâ€™s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
